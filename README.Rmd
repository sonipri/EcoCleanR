# EcoCleanR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of EcoCleanR is to provides tools to integrate biodiversity data from multiple aggregators and offers a step-by-step framework for data cleaning, outlier detection, and the generation of species biogeographic ranges. It also supports the extraction of relevant environmental information to assist in ecological and biogeographic analyses.

## Installation

You can install the development version of EcoCleanR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sonipri/EcoCleanR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(EcoCleanR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
